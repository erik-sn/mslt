# Make Stuff & Learn Things

### A guide/journal/blog to document things I am...making or learning

### About:
I asked one of the mechanics I work with what he thought I, as an engineer, did for a living. "You make stuff and learn things" was his response.
It's a vague but reasonable answer, so I told him I would use it to name an idea I had. Also I'm bad at naming things.
